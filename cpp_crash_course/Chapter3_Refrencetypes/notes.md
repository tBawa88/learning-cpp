### When to use which?
- If you need to frequently update the value of your reference (meaning which underlying object it's pointing to), then use pointers.
- For example, Data structures like Linked lists, where you need to update the value of a node pointer to walk the list

- But if you are not going to reseat the reference, and care more about the saftey, then "references" are the go-to refernce type
